## What is SourceTree for Mac?

SourceTree for Mac is a **free, powerful graphical user interface (GUI) for Git and Mercurial version control systems**, developed by Atlassian. It is designed to simplify and enhance the workflow of developers on macOS by providing a visual representation of repositories, making complex version control operations intuitive and accessible.

The application eliminates the need for memorizing command-line instructions, offering a streamlined interface for cloning, committing, pushing, pulling, branching, and merging. With support for both Git and Mercurial, it caters to a wide range of development environments. SourceTree's interactive commit graph provides a clear history of project changes, while its built-in diff tool allows for precise review of modifications before committing.

Key features include a simple and clear repository setup, seamless integration with Bitbucket and GitHub, and powerful tools for managing submodules and large files. It is fully optimized for **macOS Ventura and Sonoma** and runs natively on both **Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs**, ensuring fast and responsive performance. Whether you are a solo developer or part of a large team, SourceTree for Mac helps you focus on writing code instead of managing version control commands.
